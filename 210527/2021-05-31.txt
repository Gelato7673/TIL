// Today I did

Think and search about hls problem.
I think it's not make sense to make soundwave in front-end side. 
because hls streaming module get data from server not at once. 


// Today I learned

* hls url usually have cors header problem.

* problem
hls 가 정말 문제인게, data가 실시간으로 로딩되기 때문에 waveform을 만들수가 없네. 
그러면, serverside rending을 이용해야하는데, 
그러면, 기존 모듈을 아예쓸 수가 없다는 거니까..
음, bbc 모듈에서는 어떨려나?
wavesurfer에서는 별다른 문제를 찾을 수 없으려나?
