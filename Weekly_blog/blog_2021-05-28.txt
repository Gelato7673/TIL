2. estimate the period of development
when we requested estimate the period, we need to consider a lot of situation make it carefully.
 
so, this is the process to estimate period (I recommended like this)
- analyzed planning documentation
- planning
- separating the works
- estimating the schedule
- development
- test
- debugging
- launch

and, some people recommend to make the excel table following these kinds of things. (I classified following the agile words)
- Classify the work
	- Epic
	- UserStory
	- task
- Priority
- Level of difficulty
- Estimated day
- Real date
- Dead line

and, some people recommend me to multiply 2.5 from the date you pop up directly. if you are the newcomer. It also helpful sometimes.

In my case, I used these kinds of things.
at first, I just separate each of task by epic and make the user story as chunk, think about what kinds of feature and task will be happen in this story. 
I usually separate the chunk of story details, so It's usually one feature has one story. but, sometimes one story has the various feature or task.
we can give the size like T-shirts each of them following the complexity.

I think, imagine the task is quite important, and we could check the problem,
and I wrote the problem that I expected, if this problem is big. I estimated more days.

And, I just review the each of user story following guide line (from the point of front-end developer)

* Back-end
- reviewing the code
- make new feature (networking function)
- test or debugging the code
- conversation

* Design
- searching the reference
- conversation
- making new feature (styling)
- reviewing the design

* Front-end
- searching the reference, or hwo to make new feature.
- making new feature
- test or debugging the code
- refactoring the code

* meeting buffer
- we usually had the meeting every week. and some times we need to calculate the buffer. (somepeople recommend it's better etimating :1 week is 4days)

And then, I estimate the day as each of item of guide line.
and, when I summarize the date. It usually 5 days by one story because I also debugging and testing and requesting about back-end data.

I don't know it's alright. after doing this schedule. 
I think I need to adjust the way to estimate schedule.
