About the id
Can I change the time set?

Id :1,
“data” : [
{
	begin: 10,
	end: 20,
	volume : 1
},
{
	begin: 10,
	end: 20,
	volume : 1
},
{
	begin: 10,
	end: 20,
	volume : 1
},
{
	begin: 10,
	end: 20,
	volume : 1
}
]

array to 10
after checking the point will be changed to the internet. 
we need to think about the asynchronization.

------

0-0. net ) downloading the data (not empty)
0-1. net ) downloading the data (empty background)

1. net ) downloading the data. first => set) state
2. showing the detected the sound data using the state. 
3. if the event will be happen like a drag => set) state => net ) change the server data
4. if the delete event will be happen => set) state as null or zero => net ) change the server data
5. when click export => set ) null data will be deleted from the stat => net ) change the server data

----------------

- detect the section 
- playing the music
- zoom in & out

----------------
