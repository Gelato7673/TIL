Today I learned

*Connecting github on ssh (multiple account!)

- https://medium.com/@sunnkis/github-ssh-%EB%A5%BC-%ED%99%9C%EC%9A%A9%ED%95%98%EC%97%AC-%EC%97%AC%EB%9F%AC-%EA%B3%84%EC%A0%95-%EA%B4%80%EB%A6%AC-%EB%B0%A9%EB%B2%95-7ec29bd0186d

what is the ssh?
- 생활코딩 : https://opentutorials.org/module/432/3742
- ssh key : https://baked-corn.tistory.com/m/52


How can I do?

1. cheking your ssh key
- $ ls -al ~/.ssh

2. making first ssh key
- $ ssh-keygen -t rsa

3. making second ssh key (additional)
- $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "work@mail.com" -f "id_rsa_work"

4. checking generating ssh key correctly
- $ ls -al ~/.ssh
(usually .ssh file is positioned on aesoo)

5. resitrating on github
- seeting -> ssh key -> copypast
- copy cli : $ pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (or additional file name)

6. Using ssh-agent
- (checking it's used on background): $ eval “$(ssh-agent -s)”

7. adding ssh-agent
- $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
- $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work (additional file name)

8. checking registration
- ssh-add -l

9. making ssh config file.
- making config file in .ssh directory. (if config file existed, you can skip this step. just add follow contents)
- write down contents
# personal account
Host github.com
   HostName github.com
   User git
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   
# working account
Host github.com-work    
   HostName github.com
   User git
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work

10. trying to clone from github
(Don't forget to github.com-work when you clone respository from working account, and you should clone on ssh)
- $ git clone git@github.com:userName/userRepository.git
- $ git clone git@github.com-work:workerName/workerRepository.git
