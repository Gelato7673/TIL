Today I learned

* today I did

In this week, I refactored my codes because of synce.
at the first time, I just think using plugin or modify some code to combine two modules.
but, In case of video module, sometimes delayed because of buffering. so, In my opinion, making the module to check these kinds of condition. for this. I think I need to modify middleware to control two modules. and, because It's related with other things. So, I need to refactor other codes. 
So, I think work is some delayed. but, I expect the other part will be better than now. because code was refactored, many potential problem will be solved. so, I think nextweek, I'll work about refactoring works.

About Reducer
https://ko.redux.js.org/recipes/structuring-reducers/using-combinereducers/

=========
remember about redux

function mapStateToProps(state) {
    return { VideoSound: state.a };
}

export default connect(mapStateToProps)(Simple);

// sample backup


// import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit"
// import { combineReducers } from 'redux'
// import userAuthReducer from './userAuth'
// import VideoSoundReducer from './VideoSound'

// const reducer = combineReducers({
//     userAuth: userAuthReducer,
//     VideoSound: VideoSoundReducer,
//   })
// const store = configureStore({
//     reducer,
// })
// export default store;

import { configureStore, createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit"

const userAuth = createSlice({
  name: "userAuthReducer",
  initialState: {
    a: "false",
  },
  reducers: {
      signIn: (state, action) => {state.a = action.payload}
  }
})

export const { signIn } = userAuth.actions;
const store = configureStore({reducer: userAuth.reducer});
export default store;


===========
backup of index.js

import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit"
import { combineReducers } from 'redux'
import userAuthReducer from './userAuth'
import VideoSoundReducer from './VideoSound'

const reducer = combineReducers({
    // here we will be adding reducers
    userAuth: userAuthReducer,
    VideoSound: VideoSoundReducer,
  })
const store = configureStore({
    reducer,
})
export default store;

Hello, Nico. I always appreciate for your lecture. 
I have a some problem about configureStore.
when I follow the lecture, It's working well. but, when I add one more slice and and also add additional reducer in configureStore. It just called the state value as undefineded. Do you know the reason?
This is my code. 
(I also tried with combineReducers as rootReducer It's not working too.)

import { combineReducers, configureStore, createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit"

const helloSlice = createSlice({
  name: "first",
  initialState: {
    person: "hello",
  },
  reducers: {
    entrance: (state, action) => {state.person = action.payload}
  }
})

const secondSlice = createSlice({
  name: "second",
  initialState: {
    food: "Kimchi",
  },
  reducers: {
    dinner: (state, action) => {state.food = action.payload}
  }
})

export const { entrance } = helloSlice.actions;
export const { dinner } = secondSlice.actions;

const store = configureStore({ 
   reducer: {
     helloReducer: helloSlice.reducer,
     secondReducer: secondSlice.reducer
   }
});

export default store;

asynce 로 한번 해주고.
