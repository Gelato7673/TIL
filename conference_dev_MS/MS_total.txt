Stand by Music Swapper

The project state

This article is written to record the changes through the meeting, and the issue needed to have a conversation before reworking.

firstly, This project's front-end is designed basis on the totally realtime system. like following example.

1. When user upload the video, It's analyzed and create new project directly. 
2. When user click the exporting button, Sound and music is merged directly.

but, you know, this is not suitable the our real system (if you have curious, please read this article.. https://github.com/cochlearai/music-swapper/blob/doc/standby_state.md#server)

so, we changed some plan to add progress bar when user wating the next step. but, It's not designed completely. after checking the data, we need to design and make the feature. 

Second, we shrinked the function that is not essential but we had to waste a lot of time, or has the real-time issue.

1. If user upload the music, It's changed hls url and play the music.
2. Change the dimension
3. If user select the section they want change in recommended music, It's merged immediatly to original sound and It's played. 

Third, we need to change or make more feature on next working
1. Login page - after being constructed user management system, the page related auth need to be chagned.
2. Onboarding page - after finishing the other steps, we need to make the video for onboarding page.

Third, we arranged many issued progressing the project, but It remained many issues that I should deal with like following list
- Hls problem
- Suggestion : Separate the process
- Siletn section

Finally, when someone develop this project, please keep in mind that this has many variable situation, so the developer need to have a conversatation enoughly with the other part, and develop this project as step by step.
