This week I finish the axis page and upload our officia-web.
and I searched and set the Jira project and had conversation about it with designer and I'll have meeting with related one.
and, now I'm working about standby of the project. Music swapper.
so, I'm writting the documentation of music swapper we could remember the situation when we stopped, and manage this project easier to the next turn.
and next week, I'll revise the documentation. Maybe, It's related with hugo.


-----
It just the thinking about music swapper (personality thinking and plan)
and, we need to arrange Jira board as the user story based. and we need to record the bug we'll fix.
and, I'll arrange the some code about music swapper.
