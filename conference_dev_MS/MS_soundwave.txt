Sound wave

Eventhough, we choose the fourth of the front article in our process, It's still remained the issues about soundwave.

this issue was happened because hls just send the data as chunk, front-end side couldn't make sound wave form at once. 

so, if we use the hls reamin, the make the sound wave data from back-end and send the front-end side and font-end make it visualization.

I didn't find clear module about it, but quite deserve careful study, if we choose the option 4 about our process. 

as I know, many other language already has the module to make sound wave data. like following link.

before starting again, let's talk about it!
