The goal of this article is sharing the condition of code in music swapper projects' front-end side. 

open source
- wave surfer
- video.js 7 (hls option included)
- video.js-wavesurfer (further changed)

The code is mixed tsx and js, it quite complexed. 
but when I found the tsx module about wave-surfer and video-js, I couldn't found suitable module in tsx. 

but, if we found after time, we need to transform js to tsx.

and, now font-end code just use the temporary url about video and sounds data because, the url from server has cors problem.

we need to think about solve this problem, and change code to get data from server.

The last version of this project is stored in separate branch.
