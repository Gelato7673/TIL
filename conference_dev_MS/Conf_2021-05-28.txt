// In this week.
- I estiamted the work about music swapper, and made the schedule. 
- and music swapper team has the meeting about new added page. 
- and, next week, I'll work again about music swapper I guess. 

--------
// Music swapper sharing

1. I estimated the schedule basis on user story point. 

2. when I make this schedule, I consider checking data base, and request the modification, and hed modify the feature, and I make the feature again. and. some kinds of user story need help from designer. like progress or new pages. 
In case of new design feature, we'll have conversation together. 
I consider these kinds of things. 

3. I think we'll use Jira like this. 
I'll update the nex week and Two weeks later work update, every week. 
so, we could prepare or think the task. 
or, if yours has a lot of the other work. or yours waana to do the other work as flow, just sharing with me in meeting. 
so, I'll change the schedule. 

5. so, I think next week, I'll solve the sound problem, and hyojeong make mock up and user story board. 
actually, I think mock-up and user story board should make together. 

If Ui/Ux team make this one, It's easier that front-end, back-end ready the new feature. 
I know it's the first time. but, I think this single page is the good example to start this work. 
because, It's small and simple. 

6. so, we have some issue about silent video and chunk, and uploading music module from user desktop.

you can do that. or you can request to new designer. It's your free. 
anyway, anything is fine. I just think this is the good start point to experience the process.
