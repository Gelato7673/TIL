Today I learned / Did

1. How can I change the about-us page?!
I wanna to chagne 'about-us' to open in the new tabs.

try.
1. Saving the data in session or local storgage.

if you want use this way, you need to set function, and event point..
but event point is a lot. I can't point one event.

2. so, I think I deliver the data as url. (with parameter like.. ?)
It's working at local! but, It's fail to server.
I notice this site (with gatsby) used router. so, It's not easy to open new tabs in the framework.

so, I asked ben about opinion about this things.

He also think... It's need to change structure like a news room.

--------
Why I fumbled for two days..?

1. I don't know js6, react. 
2. I didn't understand about gatsby... 

... anyway...

** I think if I try to find similar case in this homepage, maybe I can solve this problem easier.
